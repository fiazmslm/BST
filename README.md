#### BST

Here I will write code for the BST in C++ and GOLANG

Following functions I will write here,

    search()
    findSibling()
    findParent()
    isPrimeEvenOdd()
    getLeft()
    setLeft()
    getRight()
    setRight()
    isLeaf()
    insert()
    getLeftChild()
    getRightChild()

Then I will write a driver code in main and test.

#### Setup

```bash
sudo apt-get install g++
```

```bash
which g++
```

## Start

To run the code in the terminal

you need to complie using
```bash
 g++ main.cpp -o outputFileName
```

Run the compiled code as
```bash
./fileName.out
```
